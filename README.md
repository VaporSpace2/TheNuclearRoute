# TheNuclearRoute
A mod made for a game called Spaceflight Simulator, dedicated towards interplanetary and interstellar travel along with the required and supporting infrastructure, plus more QOL parts.

## Engines

1. Zodiak OCGCR
   /pictures/ZodiakOCGCR.png
   *"Open cycle gas core reactor engine, super high thrust and super high efficiency. Uses nuclear pellets as fuel."*

   extremely overpowered engine, has high efficiency and even higher thrust, this engine is most based on reality and is actually surpisingly balanced assuming you arent using it on a 5 ton craft but rather a 700 ton craft.
   * 890 tons of thrust.
   * 4500 seconds of specific impulse.
   * weighs 12 tons.
   * 4 tiles wide, 6.75 tiles tall.


3. Cerberus FFR
  /pictures/CerberusFFR.png
  *"Uses finely crushed nuclear pellets to react and melt into each other, breaking off from spinning disks and ionizing, being blasted through the engine nozzle at a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Uses nuclear pellets"*

   This engine has had to have its thrust greatly increased from its real life counterpart so that it doesnt take literal irl days but only a couple minutes to make a burn for mars or another solar system.
   * 3.5 tons of thrust.
   * 500000 seconds of specific impulse.
   * weighs 6 tons.
   * 6 tiles wide, 4 tiles tall.


4. VASIMR
      /pictures/VASIMR.png
      *"Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket, super efficient and high power for an electric thruster. The higher the throttle is set to, the more fuel is used for the some acceleration. Uses xenon gas as fuel"*

      The only near future engine here that has been ever conceived, extremely tiny thrust but really good efficiency, this is the go to engine for a realistic mars mission with a non overpowered engine. It has had to have its thrust increased to be fun to use. 
      * 5 tons of thrust.
      * base 4000 seconds of specific impulse, the equation for specific impulse is -2500 * throttle + 4000, with 1500 being its full throttle ISP.
      * weighs 2.5 tons.
      * 3 tiles wide, 4 tiles long.
     

5. Scorpion
     /pictures/Scorpion.png
   *"Open cycle chemical combustion engine, good efficiency and thrust. meant to be used as an efficient landing engine. uses liquid fuel."*
   *"Scorpion engine but with a shroud so you can use the slim landing legs with it. uses liquid fuel."*

   higher thrust than other vacuum engines of its own size, but slightly lower efficiency, the shrouded version has an adjustable cover that can go from 0 - 4 tiles in length.
   * 75 tons of thrust.
   * 275 seconds of specific impulse.
   * weighs 3 tons.
   * 4 tiles wide, 4.1 tiles long.
  

## other parts

1. Small communications dish
   /pictures/antenna.png
   *"A small retractable communications dish"*

   This part is purely for visuals, and is meant to represent an extendable medium range (planet to orbiting spacecraft) communications dish.
   * 0.015 tons
   * 4 tiles wide, 3 when extended.
   * 1.65 tiles tall, 12.85 when extended.


2. Slim landing legs
   /pictures/legs.png
   *"Slim landing leg with a shell around it so it doesnt look ugly"*
   *"An advanced looking version of the slim leg. differences are purely visual"*

   Landing legs meant to look good, their extension distance isnt too crazy but they work especially well with the scorpion engine for landers. the advanced version is meant to look sleeker and better.
   * weighs 0.75 tons.
   * 7 tiles tall, 5.75 for advanced leg.
   * 0.8 tiles wide.
   * legs extension distance: 3 tiles downwards, 0.2 tiles outwards.


3. Gyroscope
   /pictures/gyroscope.png
   *"Used for helping steer the vessel with an immense amount of torque"*

   A configurable reaction control wheel, with its torque being able to be set with a slider. The power slider sets the torque to input power * mass of the gryoscope.
   * 2 tons of density.
   * 0 - 500 power slider, sets torque to power * mass.
   * adapts and sizes just like a fuel tank.
